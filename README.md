Add new entries by typing them into the blank row at the bottom of the data grid view. You need to click the Search button at least once in order to see it. Only the ID field is required. ID should refer to an existing scale identifier. If the number entered doesn't stick, it means that that particular number is already in use. Duplicate IDs are not permitted. Luckily, you can change the IDs of existing entries. When you're finished editing a row, be sure to click the Commit button before navigating to a different row, or else your changes will be forgotten.
