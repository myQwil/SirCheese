Add new entries by typing them into the blank row at the bottom of the data grid view. You need to click the Search button at least once in order to see it.

Only the ID field is required. ID should refer to an existing scale identifier. If the number entered doesn't stick, it means that 
that particular number is already in use. Duplicate IDs are not permitted. Luckily, you can change the IDs of existing entries.

When you're finished editing a row, click the Commit button to save it to the database. Changes not committed will be lost upon performing another search.

To delete a row, click on the left-most column (with no header) to select the entire row. Then simply press the Delete key. A dialog will appear to confirm the decision, both for delete and commit actions.
